# eSportsMatcher
Ruby on Rails web app to match participants in CSM eSports tournaments more fairly and automatically.

## Goals (User Stories)
1. Users can create and edit their own profiles.
2. Users can register for individual tournaments.
3. Admins should be able to automatically generate teams from registered users for a tournament
4. Admins should be able to create brackets that show in what order teams will play each other.
5. Admins can input the results of tournamnets to help improve the matching system for the next tournament.
6. For now, League of Legends team matching is the most important ... but creating a system that extends nicely to other games should be kept in mind.
7. Users should be able to view other users profiles/play histories.
